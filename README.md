# Introduction

    This it's a package that I plan to use as base of my laravel development API. It's implements the SAP Porto 
    architeture as described in: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mahmoudz/Porto
    
    The code is based on : https://github.com/apiato/core , but I'm making some changes on my end to make it 
    easier/lighter for me to use and implement it.
    
    If fits you, you're free to use.
